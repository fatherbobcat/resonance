Resonance takes place in a world without light. Years of diminishing solar energy finally culminate in the death of the nearest star. Over the years lifeforms on the planet have managed to adapt to the lack of light and  now thrive upon sound energy. These lifeforms feed on the sounds made by other lifeforms and the environment, absorbing the energy through evolved auditory organs. The primary inhabitants of the world have managed to adapt to their lightless environments as well by developing primitive echolocation technology. Despite their technological advancement, however, many of the primary inhabitants have mysteriously disappeared. Only sounds of the past echo through the ruins of a once dazzling paradise where the sun no longer shines. Armed with only your trusty echolocation device, evade aggressive monsters and discover what this world has become.
