Name for Project: Project Sound
Name of development team: Dark Energy

Project Description:
Our project is a top-down perspective survival game that utilizes echo location. 
The level is a maze-light construct and the objective is to reach the end of the 
level while also completing smaller objectives. Initially the level is completely 
dark. The player’s perception is based on a sonar-style system. The player has the 
ability to “ping”, or release a concentric ring of sound, which illuminates the 
players surroundings (walls, items and enemies) by reflection. Each ping costs a 
certain amount of “sound points”, which can be recharged by absorbing sound emitted 
from different sources. Also note that the player does not have enough sound points 
to reach the end of the level initially. There are multiple enemies per level that 
attempt to find the player and kill him/her. The enemies utilize a similar mechanic 
of echo-location to find players (the players can absorb sound emitted by enemies 
that are pinging). The envisioned gameplay combines strategy, exploration, survival 
and light-puzzle elements.
